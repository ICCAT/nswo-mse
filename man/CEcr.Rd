  Data_Lag = 1,
  Interval = 3,

\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in the data object}

\item{Data}{An object of class `Data`}

\item{Data_Lag}{The number of years to lag the data}

\item{Interval}{The TAC update interval}

\item{tunepar}{Parameter used for tuning}

\item{mc}{The maximum fractional change in the TAC among years. NA to ignore}

\item{yrs}{numeric values length 2. The year index to calculate the historical mean catches and index,
and the years to smooth the estimate of current exploitation rate}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused)}
}
\value{
An object of class `Rec` with the `TAC` slot populated
}
\description{
This MP aims to keep the exploitation rate at a constant level. The current relative
exploitation rate is calculated as the mean of the catches from 2016:2020 divided
by the mean Combined Index over this same period.
