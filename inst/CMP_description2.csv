CMP name,Type,Abundance indicator,Description
CE,Empirical,Combined index,"Aims to maintain a constant exploitation rate (ER) at mean of 2016 - 2020. A HCR linearly reduces the ER if the current index is between 50% - 80% of the mean index from this same time period. If the current index is less than 50% of the mean historical index, exploitation rate is set to 10% of the mean historical ER. TAC is constrained to change no more than 25% between management cycles."
MCC9,Empirical,Combined index,Aims to maintain a mostly constant catch (MCC). The TAC is adjusted between a set of 9 steps based on the ratio of the mean index over the 3 most recent years compared to the mean index from 2017 - 2019
MCC11,Empirical,Combined index,Similar to MCC9 but the 11 steps are used to adjust the TAC 
SPSSFox,Model,Combined index,"A state-space surplus production model is fit to the index and catch data. A constant F (Ftarget) is set (determined as a tuning parameter) and the TAC calculated by applying the F to the model's estimate of abundance. A linear harvest control rule reduces Ftarget to 0.1Ftarget if estimated B/BMSY < BMSY. If estimated B/BMSY < 0.4BMSY, Ftarget set to 0.1Ftarget. TAC is constrained to change no more than 25% between management cycles."
SPSSFox2,Model,Combined index,"Same as SPSSFox, except there is no constraint on reduction in TAC if estimated B/BMSY < 1."
