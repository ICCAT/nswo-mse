CMP name,Type,Abundance indicator,Description
CE,Empirical,Combined index,Constant exploitation rate
MCC5,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 5 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide a stable TAC. To do this it uses a base TAC which has the possibility of increasing by one step and decreasing by 2 steps. These steps are selected depending on the value of the current 3-yr average of the Combined Index compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). The a minimum TAC set at 4kt when the current 3-yr average of the Combine Index is less than half of the 3-yr historical average.
MCC7,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 7 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide a stable TAC. To do this it uses a base TAC which has the possibility of increasing by four small steps and decreasing by 2 steps. These steps are selected depending a value of the current 3-yr average of the Combined Index compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). The a minimum TAC is set at 50 per cent of the base TAC when the current 3-yr average of the Combine Index is less than half of the 3-yr historical average. When the 3-yr average of the combined Index is calculated a smoother is used to reduce its variability year-to-year.
SPSSFox,Model,Combined index,A Fox surplus production model with a harvest control rule that throttles F when estimated biomass is below target level.
FX4,Empirical,Combined index,The combined index is subjected to a median smoother of length 3 and then the deciles of the smoothed index are compared with the average of the most recent 3 years of data in order to find the appropriate percentile interval and associated percent TAC change. The percent TAC change adjusts a base TAC which varies according to the PGK_short tuning objective.
C1320,Empirical,NA,"A constant harvest scenario where the TAC is fixed at a level that achieves the PGK short 0.51, 0.60 and 0.70 objectives."
