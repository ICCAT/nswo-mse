Class,Description
Reference,"Nine models spanning the key plausible uncertainties in natural mortality (M) and steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship (h). Same as Base Case with 3 levels of M (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and 3 levels of h (0.69, 0.80, 0.88)"
R0,Reference OM for the Robustness Tests. OM 5 of the Reference Set
R1,"Evaluate impact of an assumed 1% annual increase catchability, that is not accounted for in the standardization of the indices of abundance (historical and projection)"
R2,"Same as R1, but bias in the indices of abundance is only for the historical period "
R3,Robustness test to evaluate the ability of the CMPs to recover the stock from a low initial level. The historical indices were modified by adding a persistent slope such that the SB/SBMSY = 0.6 in the terminal year of the OM conditioning
R4,Evaluate impact of cyclical pattern in recruitment deviations in projection period; a proxy for impact of climate change on stock productivity
R5,Evaluate impact of lower than expected recruitment deviations for first 15 years of projection period; a proxy for impact of climate change on stock productivity
R6,"Evaluate impact of illegal, unreported, or unregulated catches"
