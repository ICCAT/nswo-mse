Class,Description
Base Case,"The 2022 Stock Assessment, considered the Base Case OM"
Reference,"Nine models spanning the key plausible uncertainties in natural mortality (M) and steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship (h). Same as Base Case with 3 levels of M (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and 3 levels of h (0.69, 0.80, 0.88)"
R0,"Reference OM for the Robustness Tests. MOM_005; M=0.2, h=0.8"
R1,"Evaluate impact of an assumed 1% annual increase catchability, that is not accounted for in the standardization of the indices of abundance (historical & projection)"
R2,"Same as R2, but only for the historical period"
R3a,Evaluate impact of cyclical pattern in recruitment deviations in projection period; a proxy for impact of climate change on stock productivity
R3b,Evaluate impact of lower than expected recruitment deviations for first 15 years of projection period; a proxy for impact of climate change on stock productivity
R4,"Evaluate impact of illegal, unreported, or unregulated catches"
