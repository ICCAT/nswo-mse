CMP name,Type,Abundance indicator,Description
AT1,Empirical,"CDN, JPN, CHT, MOR, POR, USA, SPN",The indices are smoothed and averaged together using inverse variance weighting. A ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
CE,Empirical,Combined index,Constant exploitation rate
CI1,Empirical,Combined index,The index is smoothed and a ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
EA1,Empirical,"MOR, POR, SPN",The indices are smoothed and averaged together using inverse variance weighting. A ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
GSC2,Empirical,Combined index,
MCC2,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 2 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2018-2020).
MCC3,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 3 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019).
MCC4,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 4 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). MCC4 differs from MCC3 by implementing smoother for the Combine Index..
MCC5,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 5 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide a stable TAC. To do this it uses a base TAC which has the possibility of increasing by one step and decreasing by 2 steps. These steps are selected depending on the value of the current 3-yr average of the Combined Index compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). The a minimum TAC set at 4kt when the current 3-yr average of the Combine Index is less than half of the 3-yr historical average.
MCC7,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 7 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide a stable TAC. To do this it uses a base TAC which has the possibility of increasing by four small steps and decreasing by 2 steps. These steps are selected depending a value of the current 3-yr average of the Combined Index compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). The a minimum TAC is set at  50% of the base TAC when the current 3-yr average of the Combine Index is less than half of the 3-yr historical average. When the 3-yr average of the combined Index is calculated a smoother is used to reduce its variability year-to-year.
SPSS,Model,Combined index,Schaefer surplus production model with a harvest control rule that throttles F when estimated biomass is below target level.
SPSSFox,Model,Combined index,A Fox surplus production model with a harvest control rule that throttles F when estimated biomass is below target level.
WA1,Empirical,"CDN, USA, JPN, CHT",The indices are smoothed and averaged together using inverse variance weighting. A ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
FX2,Empirical,"CDN, JPN, CHT, MOR, POR, USA, SPN","The 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentiles of each index are compared to the average of the most recent 3 years of data in order to find the appropriate percentile interval and associated percent TAC change. The average percent TAC change across the 7 indices adjusts a base TAC which varies according to the PGK_short tuning objective."
FX4,Empirical,Combined index,The combined index is subjected to a median smoother of length 3 and then the deciles of the smoothed index are compared with the average of the most recent 3 years of data in order to find the appropriate percentile interval and associated percent TAC change. The percent TAC change adjusts a base TAC which varies according to the PGK_short tuning objective.
C1320,Empirical,NA,"A constant harvest scenario where the TAC is fixed at a level that achieves the PGK_short 0.51, 0.60 and 0.70 objectives."
