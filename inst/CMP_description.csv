CMP name,Type,Abundance indicator,Description
AT1,Empirical,"CDN, JPN, CHT, MOR, POR, USA, SPN",The indices are smoothed and averaged together using inverse variance weighting. A ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
CE,Empirical,Combined index,Constant exploitation rate
CI1,Empirical,Combined index,The index is smoothed and a ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
EA1,Empirical,"MOR, POR, SPN",The indices are smoothed and averaged together using inverse variance weighting. A ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
GSC2,Empirical,Combined index,
MCC2,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 2 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2018-2020).
MCC3,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 3 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019).
MCC4,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 4 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). MCC4 differs from MCC3 by implementing smoother for the Combine Index..
MCC5,Empirical,Combined index,Mostly Constant Catch 5 (MCC) focuses on trying to provide stable TAC and only deviates when the 3-yr average of the Combined Index increases or decreases by large amount compared to a 3-yr historical average (2017-2019). MCC5 differs from MCC3 by implementing a set TAC of 5kt when the average Combine Index hits a lower limit.
SPSS,Model,Combined index,Schaefer surplus production model with a harvest control rule that throttles F when estimated biomass is below target level.
SPSSFox,Model,Combined index,A Fox surplus production model with a harvest control rule that throttles F when estimated biomass is below target level.
WA1,Empirical,"CDN, USA, JPN, CHT",The indices are smoothed and averaged together using inverse variance weighting. A ratio of the average of the most recent 3 years of the index and the average of the period from 2015 to 2020 dedicates the percentage change in the TAC. TACs are limited to a 20% change.
FX2,Empirical,"CDN, JPN, CHT, MOR, POR, USA, SPN","The 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentiles of each index are compared to the average of the most recent 3 years of data in order to find the appropriate percentile interval and associated percent TAC change. The average percent TAC change across the 7 indices adjusts a base TAC which varies according to the PGK_short tuning objective."
C1320,Empirical,NA,"A constant harvest scenario where the TAC is fixed at a level that achieves the PGK_short 0.51, 0.60 and 0.70 objectives."
