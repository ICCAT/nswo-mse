  {"id":"carruthersDataLimitedMethodsToolkit2018a","abstract":"A simulation-based approach known as management strategy evaluation (MSE) is increasingly used by resource managers to identify management procedures that are robust to uncertainties in system dynamics. The majority of global fish populations are data limited and there is large uncertainty over their population and exploitation dynamics. The Data-Limited Methods Toolkit (DLMtool) is an R package that allows for rapid and flexible MSE specification. The package consolidates a large number of existing data-limited management procedures and allows for rapid MSE testing of new approaches. The DLMtool package has supported transparent and rigorous decision-making for a number of data-limited populations, identifying robust management procedures and revealing performance trade-offs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Carruthers","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Hordyk","given":"Adrian R."}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13081","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13081","page":"2388-2395","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Data-Limited Methods Toolkit (DLMtool): An R package for informing management of data-limited populations","title-short":"The Data-Limited Methods Toolkit (DLMtool)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13081","volume":"9"}
