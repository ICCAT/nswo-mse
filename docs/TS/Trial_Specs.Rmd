# Introduction

The North Atlantic swordfish fishery, under the management of the [International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna](https://www.iccat.int/en/index.asp) (ICCAT), is undergoing a management strategy evaluation (MSE) process.

ICCAT describes [MSE](https://www.iccat.int/mse/en/index.asp) as:

> a collaborative process between Scientists and decision-makers that involves using computer simulation to compare the relative ability to achieve a set of management objectives using alternative Management Strategies, defined as different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis, harvest control rules and subsequent processes leading to management actions.

There are three main components in an MSE process:

1.  **Operating models (OMs)**: a collection of mathematical/statistical models that describe alternative hypotheses of the historical fishery dynamics and specifications for simulating the collection of data and implementation of management measures in the future;
2.  **Candidate management procedures (CMPs)**: a set of proposed algorithms that generate management recommendations from fishery data, and will be evaluated in the MSE;
3.  **Performance metrics (PMs)**: statistics use the quantitatively evaluate the CMPs against specified management objectives.

The operating models, candidate management procedures, and performance metrics are developed as a collaborative effort between scientists, decision-makers, and other stakeholders in the fishery.

# MSE Framework

The `SWOMSE` R package has been developed to conduct the MSE for the Atlantic swordfish fishery. All code used for the MSE is open-source and reproducible. Group members can install the package and reproduce the analysis on their own machines.

The `SWOMSE` package used for the swordfish MSE uses the `openMSE` framework. The `openMSE` package is automatically installed when `SWOMSE` is installed, and all `openMSE` functions are available to the user when the `SWOMSE` package is loaded.

`openMSE` is an R package that has been developed for conducting fast, flexible, and transparent, MSE for a wide range of fisheries. `openMSE` is an umbrella package that includes the `MSEtool`, `SAMtool` and `DLMtool` packages. A non-technical description of `openMSE` and its key features is available on the [`openMSE` website](https://openmse.com/).

The operating model in `openMSE`, including assumptions and equations, is described in detail in @carruthersDataLimitedMethodsToolkit2018.

The [`SWOMSE` User Manual](../UserManual/User_Manual.html) includes instructions for installing the `SWOMSE` package and running the MSE analyses. 


# Stock Assessment {#stock-assessment}

Previously, the swordfish operating models were based on the 2017 stock assessment [@anon.Report2017ICCAT2017] using Stock Synthesis 3 [SS3, @methotStockSynthesisBiological2013].

A new stock assessment was conducted in 2022. The swordfish operating models have been updated based on this new assessment.

The report for the 2022 stock assessment is published in [SCRS/2022/012](https://www.iccat.int/Documents/CVSP/CV079_2022/n_2/CV079020392.pdf). Details of the 2022 assessment are published in [SCRS/2022/124](../SCRS_Papers/Schirripa_SCRS_2022_124.pdf). The data used in the 2022 assessment, and the structure and assumptions of the assessment model are summarized in the sub-sections below.

## Data {#data}

The assessment used landings data from 8 longline fleets (7 national fleets and 'Other' representing all catches not accounted for in the national fleets) (Table \@ref(tab:fleet-info) and Figure \@ref(fig:data-fig)).

There were 6 indices of abundance derived from catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from the national fleets (Table \@ref(tab:fleet-info) and Figure \@ref(fig:data-fig)). Data from the Japan longline fleet was split into two phases: Early (1950 - 1993), and Late (1994 - 2020) due to changes in fishing practices in these periods. Similarly, the Chinese-Taipei longline fleet was split into two phases: Early (1968 - 1989) and Late (1997 - 2020). Five additional survey indices were developed from the age-specific (ages estimated from length data) CPUE from the Spain longline fleet (Table \@ref(tab:fleet-info) and Figure \@ref(fig:data-fig)).

Length composition data from 7 national longline fleets (Spain, U.S., Canada, Japan (Early, Late), Portugal, Chinese-Tapai (Early, Late), and Morocco) and the Canada/USA harpoon fleet (Figure \@ref(fig:data-fig)). Mean weight data from two fleets (U.S. and Canada) were also used (Figure \@ref(fig:data-fig)).

The catchability coefficient (*q*) for the CPUE indices for Canada, Morocco, and the Age-1, Age-2, and Age-4 Spain age-specific survey indices, was made a function of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) (see [SCRS/2022/124](../SCRS_Papers/Schirripa_SCRS_2022_124.pdf) for details).

The effective sample size (ESS) for the length composition data was established by adjusting ESS until unity was reached between modeled ESS and the Francis suggested sample size [See @anon.Report2017ICCAT2017 for details].

![(#fig:data-fig) Summary of the data used in the 2022 stock assessment.](../../img/Data_overview.png)

## Model Structure {#model-structure}

The SS3 model used one season, one area, and two sexes.

## Fixed Biological Parameters

Natural mortality for both male and female was fixed at 0.2 for all age classes. Maturity-at-age was knife-edge, with 50% at age-5 and 100% thereafter. Fecundity was proportional to body weight. The growth parameters for the 2022 assessment were fixed at same used in the 2017 assessment, which were developed during the 2017 ICCAT Swordfish Data Preparatory Meeting [See @anon.Report2017ICCAT2017 for details].

## Selectivity

Selectivity was modeled as a function of length. Dome-shaped selectivity was allowed for five fleets: EU-Spain, USA, Japan, EU-Portugal, and Morocco. Asymptotic selectivity was assumed for Canada, Chinese-Taipei and Other. The age-specific survey CPUEs were modeled with a fixed age-based selectivity.

## Retention and Discard Mortality {#retention}

The 2022 assessment assumed a minimum legal length of 119 cm lower jaw fork length (LFFL) for all fleets from 1993 - 2020, and estimated the selectivity and retention curves from the available data. Discard mortality was either estimated from the observer data (USA and Canada) or fixed at values taken from the literature (see SCRS/2022/124).

## Stock-Recruitment

Expected recruitment to age-0 was calculated from the total spawning stock biomass using the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function. The standard error for the log-normally distributed recruitment deviations (sigmaR) was fixed to 0.2. Steepness (*h*) was fixed at the value estimated in the 2017 assessment (0.88).

# Overview of Operating Model Conditioning {#om-conditioning}

The 2022 stock assessment was used as the Base Case model for developing the operating models (OMs) evaluated in the MSE.

## OM Uncertainty Grid

In 2019, the Swordfish Species Group developed an OM uncertainty grid using a full factorial design with 6 axes of uncertainty:

1.  Natural mortality (*M*) - three levels: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3

2.  Recruitment variability (sigmaR; $\sigma_R$) - two levels: 0.2, 0.6

3.  Steepness (*h*) - three levels: 0.6, 0.75, 0.90

4.  CPUE Lambda - three levels: 0.05, 1, 20

5.  Directional trend in catchability (llq) - two levels: TRUE, FALSE

6.  Environmental covariate (env) - two levels: TRUE, FALSE

The directional increase in catchability was modeled by assuming a 1% average annual increase in catchability throughout the history of the fishery, and adjusting the CPUE indices accordingly.

The environmental covariate was included by modeling catchability as a function of the AMO, as was done in the 2017 and 2022 stock assessments.

This factorial design of the 6 axes of uncertainty, each with 2 or 3 levels, resulted in an uncertainty grid of 216 OMs.

## Evaluation of the OM Grid

Previous analyses of the OM uncertainty grid based on the 2017 assessment revealed that the three levels of natural mortality and steepness had the largest impact on the predicted stock dynamics [Hordyk et al., 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_et_al_SCRS_2021_099.pdf) and are therefore the most important axes of uncertainty in the OM grid.

The second level of recruitment variability ($\sigma_R = 0.6$) had a minor impact on the predicted stock dynamics [Hordyk et al., 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_et_al_SCRS_2021_099.pdf), but did influence the relative performance of candidate management procedures [Hordyk, 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_SCRS_2021_161.pdf). This second level is now treated as a robustness test (see below for more details).

The fourth axis of uncertainty was intended to evaluate the effect of alternative relative weightings of the length composition data and the indices of abundance. The three levels reflect a complete down-weighting of the indices of abundance (0.05; effectively only fitting the model to the length composition data), leaving the relative weighting of the two data sources unchanged from that used in the assessment (1), and up-weighting the indices of abundance so the model ignores the length composition data (20). This was done because of apparent conflicting signals between the length composition data and some of the indices of abundance, and the high computation demand of conducting the recommended iterative re-weighting procedure across all OMs in the grid [@francisDataWeightingStatistical2011]. However, this iterative re-weighting procedure has now been conducted for the new operating models based on the 2022 assessment, and therefore this axis of uncertainty has been modified to two levels: 1) fit the assessment to both length and CPUE data and conduct the iterative re-weighting procedure, and 2) only fit the model to the CPUE data. This second level is now treated as a robustness test (see below for more details).

The fifth axis of uncertainty with the assumed 1% increase in catchability for the indices of abundance had a relatively minor influence on both the predicted stock dynamics [Hordyk et al., 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_et_al_SCRS_2021_099.pdf) and the performance of candidate management procedures [Hordyk, 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_SCRS_2021_161.pdf). Therefore it was decided that the default assumption for the operating models was to use the same indices as were used in the 2022 stock assessment; .e., the indices were not adjusted for an assumed 1% annual increase in changeability. The second level of this axis, where the indices are adjusted for an assumed increase in catchability, is now treated as a robustness test (see below for more details).

In both the 2017 and 2022 stock assessments, the catchability coefficient (*q*) for the CPUE indices for Canada, Japan, Portugal, Morocco, and the Spain age-specific survey indices, was made a function of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Including this environmental covariate resulted in a better statistical fit to the data for these indices. The sixth axis of uncertainty examined the impact of not including this environmental covariate in the stock assessment. The analyses revealed that removing the environmental covariate from the assessment model had no detectable influence on either the predicted stock dynamics [Hordyk et al., 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_et_al_SCRS_2021_099.pdf) or the performance of candidate management procedures [Hordyk, 2021](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/SCRS_Papers//Hordyk_SCRS_2021_161.pdf). Therefore, the environmental covariate was included in all models in the OM grid. Further examination of the impact of changing environmental conditions on the performance of the candidate management procedures may be examined in additional robustness tests (see below for more details).

This same pattern in results was found when the analyses were re-conducted with the new OM grid based on the 2022 assessment.

# Operating Models 

The OMs, conditioned using SS3, were imported into MSE framework using the `SS2MOM` function in `MSEtool` (see [here](https://msetool.openmse.com/reference/SS2MOM.html) for details on the function).

Previously, the 2-sex SS3 models were imported into a combined single-sex operating model in the MSE framework. The MSE framework was updated in 2022, and the imported operating models now maintain the separate sexes in the same manner as the SS3 assessment. Since the fishery is managed with a single overall total allowable catch (TAC), the individual fishing fleets were aggregated together in the operating models.

The 2-sex operating model are available in the `SWOMSE` package as objects of class `MOM` (multi-stock operating model). For example, the 2022 stock assessment is available as the base case operating model named `MOM_000`:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(SWOMSE)
MOM_000@Name
```

The operating models have been classified into two categories: Reference OMs and Robustness OMs. Table \@ref(tab:OM-Description) provides a general overview of the operating models includes in the MSE analysis. The following sub-sections describe the Reference and Robustness OMs in more detail.

```{r OM-Description}

caption <- 'Summary of the Base Case, Reference, and Robustness Operating Models.'

OM_desc$Description <- gsub("%", ' percent', OM_desc$Description)
OM_desc$Class <- gsub("-", ' ', OM_desc$Class)
OM_desc$Purpose <- gsub("-", ' ', OM_desc$Purpose)


OM_desc %>% knitr::kable(escape = F,
                    caption=caption,
                    booktabs=TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", full_width = T)

```

## Base Case

The Base Case operating model is the 2022 Stock Assessment. See the [Stock Assessment section](#stock-assessment) for more details.

## Reference Operating Models

The Reference OMs are based on the Base Case Model and span the plausible range for the key uncertainties. The Candidate Management Procedures (CMPs) are tuned across the Reference OMs (see the [CMP Tuning section](#tuning) for more details.

Based on the analyses described [above](#om-conditioning), a set of 6 operating models were identified as the Reference OMs. These operating models spanned the three levels of *M* (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) and two levels *h* (0.75 and 0.9).

Initially the OMs with the lower steepness value $(h=0.6)$ was also considered to be in the Reference OMs. However, recent analysis and discussion with the MSE Technical Team has revealed that a such a low steepness is unlikely for North Atlantic swordfish. Consequently, the OMs with $h=0.6$ have been re-classified into a Robustness Set. Further levels of steepness may be considered in future analyses if the results indicate that this axis of uncertainty is important for the performance and selection of the CMPs.

The Reference OMs had the following assumptions:

1.  Following the assessment, $\sigma_R = 0.2$
2.  The Francis iterative re-weighting procedure was conducted on each operating model to find the appropriate weighting between the length compostion data and the indices of abundance
3.  The standardized indices of abundance were used (i.e., no assumed 1% increase in catchability)

## R1. Lower Steepness

Robustness set 1 (R1. Lower Steepness) evaluates the performance of the CMPs under conditions where the stock has lower than expected resilience. These 3 OMs have the same assumptions as the Base Case, except that steepness (h) is fixed to 0.6, and natural mortality has three levels: 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.  

## R2. Higher sigmaR

This set of 6 operating models has the same structure and assumptions as the Reference Set, with the exception that the recruitment variability was assumed to higher $(\sigma_R = 0.6)$

## R3. Remove CAL

This set of 6 operating models has the same structure and assumptions as the Reference Set, with the exception that the model was only fit to the indices of abundance (i.e., fits to the length composition data were not included in the total likelihood).

## R4. Increase q

This set of 6 operating models had the same structure and assumptions as the Reference Set, with the exception that the indices of abundance were modified to assume an average 1% increase in catchability over the historical period. 

## R5. Increasing q {#R5}

This set of 6 operating models has the same assumptions as R4. Increase q, except that the 1% average annual increase in catchability is assumed to continue in the future. The implementation of this assumption is made in during the forward projections by passing a custom function to the CMPs which adjusts the simulated indices of abundance assuming a 1% average annual increase in catchability. 

## R6. Implementation Error

This set of 6 operating models has the same assumptions as the Reference OMs, except that there is a consistent non-reported 10% overage in the TAC in each year. This test is designed to replicate illegal, unreported, or unregulated (IUU) fishing where the actual removals are 10% higher than the TAC and reported catches. 

## R7. Climate Change - Recruitment

This set of OMs are based on the Reference OMs and includes several scenarios to evaluate the impact of climate change on the performance of the CMPs. These scenarios are designed to simulate the impact of climate change on the productivity of the stock, and are implemented in the recruitment deviations for the projection years.

Figure \@ref(fig:rec-scen) shows the Base Case (no trend in recruitment deviations) and the three scenarios:

1. Decreasing Trend: a linear decrease in recruitment strength in imposed over the recruitment deviations that are generated for the projection years. The recruitment deviations are assumed to decrease by 20% at the end of the projection period.

2. Increasing Trend: a linear increase in recruitment strength in imposed over the recruitment deviations that are generated for the projection years. The recruitment deviations are assumed to increase by 20% at the end of the projection period.

3. Increased Variability: additional variability is added to the future recruitment by sampling between the upper and lower bounds shown in the plot. 

![(#fig:rec-scen) The Base Case and 3 scenarios for persistent patterns in recruitment deviations in the projection years.](../../img/R7_Recruitment_Scenarios.png)


## R8. Size Limit

This set of 6 operating models has the same assumptions as the Reference OMs with the exception that the size limit is modified in the projection period. This change is implemented in the CMPs and includes two scenarios:

1. Fixed 120 cm Size Limit: retention is assumed knife-edge at 120 cm for all fleets, with discard mortality applied to the fish that are captured and released below this size.

2. No Size Limit: the size limit is removed and all fish that are captured are retained and contribute to the TAC.

These two scenarios are compared to the Reference OMs, which are designed to replicate the current size regulations (see [above](#retention) for more details).

## R9. Alternative Management Cycles

This set of 6 operating models has the same assumptions as the Reference OMs with the exception that the management cycle is modified from the default assumption of 3 years (see [below](#interval)) to a 4-year interval. 

# OM Validation

## OM Summary Report

A [Summary Report](../Reports/OM_Summary/2022/OM_Summary_Report.html) summarizes the diagnostic checks, the calculated biological reference points, and the estimated stock status relative to those reference points, across the Reference and Robustness operating models.

## OM Diagnostic Reports

Individual diagnostic reports with objective function values and plots of model fits and patterns in residuals are available for each of the Reference and Robustness OMs (and the 2022 assessment) on the North Atlantic Swordfish MSE [homepage](https://iccat.github.io/nswo-mse/).


# Historical Spool-Up Period

The historical spool-up period was generated by importing the output from the SS3 assessment models and running the MSE simulation framework to recreate the historical fishery dynamics. No additional uncertainty was added to the historical simulations; that is, all $`r MOM@nsim`$ simulations were identical (e.g., same recruitment deviations) for the historical spool-up period.

The operating models have been conditioned on data up to and including 2020 (see the [Data section](#data)), and therefore the projection period for the MSE framework starts in the following year, i.e., 2021. Currently, model uses assumed catches for the first three years (2021 - 2023) and then implements the management procedures in the following year (i.e., 2024). See the [Future Catches](#future-catches) section for more information.

## Historical Data

The observed fishery data was imported into the MSE framework and made available to the CMPs. Three sources of data available to the CMPs: 1) catch data, 2) a primary index of abundance, and 3) additional individual indices.

### Catch Data

The catch data used in the OM conditioning are made available in the simulated data that is provided to the CMPs (Figure \@ref(fig:catch-plot)).

![(#fig:catch-plot) The historical total catch and total allowable catch (TAC) for the North Atlantic swordfish.](../../img/Catch_TAC.png)

### Indices of Abundance

#### Primary Index

At the [2020 Swordfish MSE technical meeting (4 -- 5 June 2020)](../Meeting_Reports/2020_SWO_MSE_1_ENG.pdf), the Group chose to use the Combined Index [@ortizUpdatedCombinedBiomass2017] as the primary index for the development of CMPs. This index was updated for the 2022 assessment. The Combined Index was imported into the `SWOMSE` framework and made available to the CMPs (Figure \@ref(fig:index-plot)).

![(#fig:index-plot) The Combined Index for the North Atlantic swordfish fishery.](../../img/Combined_Index.png)

#### Other Indices

The additional individual fishery-dependent and survey indices are also imported into the MSE framework and made available to the CMPs (Figure \@ref(fig:addindex-plot)).

![(#fig:addindex-plot) The additional individual fishery-dependent and survey indices for the North Atlantic swordfish fishery.](../../img/Individual_Indices.png)

# Closed-Loop Simulation Testing

## Simulation Specifications

The current simulation specifications for the MSE are:

1.  Management interval: 3 (i.e., TAC updated every 3rd year)
2.  Number of projection years: 33 (2021 -- 2053)
3.  Number of simulations per OM: $`r MOM@nsim`$

## Assumptions

### Recruitment

The stock-recruitment relationship in the projection years was modeled using the Beverton-Holt function, with steepness fixed at the value assumed in the OM conditioning.

Recruitment deviations for the projection period were generated assuming a log-normal distribution with mean $\mu_R$ and variance $\sigma_R^2$, calculated as:

$$\mu_R = -0.5\sigma_R^2\left(1-\frac{\text{AC}}{\sqrt{(1-\text{AC}^2)}}\right)$$

where AC is the lag-1 autocorrelation factor calculated from the historical recruitment deviations and $\sigma_R^2$ is the variance of the recruitment deviations specified in the OM (i.e., sigmaR\^2 defined [above](#om-conditioning)).

The recruitment deviations for the projection period were generated independently for each simulation.

### Life-History

Biological parameters such as mean weight-at-age and maturity-at-age were constant for all years (historical and projection).

### Selectivity

Currently, the selectivity-at-length for the projection years is fixed to the estimated selectivity pattern from the last historical year for each OM. The reviewer of the `SWOMSE` R code highlighted this as a possible uncertainty and recommended that the Group consider testing alternative assumptions for the selectivity pattern in the projection years [@anon.PeerReviewNorth2021].

> The Working Group will discuss this assumption in more detail and decide if it wishes to run scenarios with alternative assumptions for the selectivity pattern in the projection years.

### Catchability

No time-varying catchability is assumed for the projection years.

### Future Catches {#future-catches}

The total allowable catch (TAC) recommended by the CMPs is assumed to be implemented without error. That is, annual catches are equal to the TAC recommendations (provided sufficient vulnerable biomass was available). The Group determined that this assumption was appropriate based on the fact that historically the total landed catch has been below the total allowable catch (TAC) (see Figure \@ref(fig:catch-plot)).

A Robustness Test (R6. Implementation Error) has been designed to evaluate the consequences of violating this assumption.

The operating models also assume that the TACs recommended by the CMPs apply to the landed catch and do not include discards; that is, the actual removals will be higher than the TACs if there is discard mortality on the sub-legal fish.

The CMPs are first implemented in 2024, and every 3rd year after that, with the TAC held constant in the interim years. Since the MSE projection period begins in 2021 (the year after the conditioning), the landed catches for the first few projection years until the CMPS are implemented (2021, 2022, and 2023) are fixed at assumed values (Table \@ref(tab:future-catches)).

```{r future-catches}

caption <- 'The assumed landed catch (ton) for the first 3 projection years.'

Catchdf %>% knitr::kable(escape = F,
                    caption=caption,
                    booktabs=TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", full_width = T)

```


## Generation of Future Data

### Indices

The primary index of abundance (Combined Index) was generated in the projection years by adding observation error to the projected stock biomass, and standardizing to be on the same scale as the historical observed Combined Index.

The additional individual indices were generated in the projection years in the same manner, using the simulated stock biomass (or abundance in some cases).

The observation error was generated by calculating the statistical properties of the residuals from the fit of each respective index to the simulated stock (biomass or abundance) during the historical period. The procedure for calculating the residuals for the projection years is described in detail in the [openMSE documentation](https://openmse.com/features-conditioning-oms/indices/).

Following the assumptions of the stock assessment, it is assumed that all indices are proportional to the respective stock biomass or abundance (i.e., it is assumed that the indices are not hyper-stable or hyper-deplete). The only exception to this is [Robustness Set 5](#R5) where the indices are assumed to have a 1% annual average increase in catchability.

### Catches

Following the assumption of the stock assessment, the observed catches in the projection years were generated with no observation error. That is, the observed catches in the MSE framework are equal to the actual simulated landed catches (provided there is sufficient biomass in the simulated population to support the prescribed TAC). The model does not include a bio-economic component and inter-annual change in fishing effort is unconstrained.

### Data Lags

Data lags of several years are common for many fisheries. For example, the 2022 assessment used data up to and including 2020. Assuming a CMP will be used to generate a TAC recommendation for 2023 based on this data, this is a data lag of 3 years.

In the MSE framework, the CMPs are always provided with the simulated fishery data up to the previous year. That is, if a CMP is implemented in year $t$, the catch and indices of abundance data provided to the CMP are up to and including year $t-1$.

Data lags are then handled in the CMP code, where the default assumption is that the catch and index data are lagged by 3 years. See the CMP (see the [CMP Development Guide](../cMPdevelopment/CMP-Development-Guide.html) for more details).

## Management Interval {#interval}

At the 2021 [Intersessional meeting](/Meeting_Reports/2021_SWO_ENG.pdf), the Group proposed a 3-year MP advice interval (see Table 5 in the [Report of the 2021 ICCAT Intersessional Meeting of the Swordfish Species Group](../Meeting_Reports//2021_SWO_ENG.pdf)).

The operating models have been conditioned on data up to 2020. As described [above](#future-catches), the catches in 2021 -- 2023 are fixed to assumed values and the CMPs are first applied in 2024.

The 3-yr management interval is applied within the CMP code (see the [CMP Development Guide](../cMPdevelopment/CMP-Development-Guide.html) for more details).

Robustness Set 9 (R9) evaluates the impact of alternative management intervals.

# Performance Metrics

TO BE UPDATED BASED ON NEW INFORMATION

Based on feedback from the Commission's Panel 4, the following preliminary performance metrics have been proposed for swordfish:

A Google sheet has also been created for the Group to add comments or additional [Performance Metrics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NytREnFCZ6OPrhXT5E5Wi8Y22w-ZmENY8kEZqDH_FQE/edit?usp=sharing).

# Candidate Management Procedures

TO BE UPDATED BASED ON NEW INFORMATION

At this point, the candidate management procedures have not yet been developed.

The Group decided that CMP development work should involve the national scientists. A small group was formed at the November 2020 MSE technical meeting, lead by Dr K. Gillespie, with the aim of continuing the CMP development work in 2021.

A [CMP Development Guide](../cMPdevelopment/CMP-Development-Guide.html) is available on the swordfish [MSE homepage](https://iccat.github.io/).
